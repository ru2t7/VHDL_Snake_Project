Hello World!

This is our first year VHDL project.
We had fun implementing the snake game and finding creative solutions to frustrating limitations. 
The documentation "SNAKE-documentation", rudimentary but satisfactory, goes into more detail, explaining the specifications, requierments
and the results of our project.
The code is divides between 3 source files, in the display file is most of the logic and implementation also using the
additional ssd and debouncer components.
The constraints can be easly replaced for adapting the project to a different board.
